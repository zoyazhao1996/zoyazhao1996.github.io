# Big Road

The simplist's solution to a mobile-only web story.

## Getting started

- Fork this repository
- Modify `index.html` to include your content
- Your web story is available on `username.github.io/big-road`

## Pre-requisite

Only one: HTML.

You don't need to actually learn it. Just fork the repository, edit the `index.html` file and observe what is changed on the page. Our experience shows that people with no background can make a web story in this way, within 3 hours, someone in 30 minutes.

## Next steps

- You can modify the repo name in the settings
- You can buy a domain and add a `CNAME` in this project, to serve your webstory from a [customized domain](https://github.com/hupili/python-for-data-and-media-communication-gitbook/blob/master/notes-week-00.md#bonus-bind-a-custom-domain-name).

## What does "Big Road" mean?

In Chinese, people say **大道至简**. HTML was born a declarative and easy-to-learn language. Its output, a "web page", was originally highly adaptive -- basically the user browser can determine how to present the information. Authors can focus on their content, instead of the format. However, the 20 years or so development of web change the situation completely, making web technology a pain for new learners. Even experienced developers find it hard to follow the latest trend. Fortunately, with the widespread of mobile device, we are back to the early years of web -- simple, and one solution for all.
